## 3. 🧠 Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 🧠

### 📚 What are CNNs?

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for processing structured grid data like images. They are particularly effective for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies and local patterns within images.

### 🔍 Key Components of CNNs

1. **Convolutional Layers**: Apply convolutional filters to input data, enabling the network to learn spatial hierarchies of features.
2. **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns.
3. **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the data, decreasing computational load and controlling overfitting.
4. **Fully Connected Layers**: Connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in another, typically used in the final layers for classification.
5. **Dropout Layers**: Randomly deactivate neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

### 🔄 Advantages of CNNs

- **Automatic Feature Extraction**: CNNs automatically learn and extract relevant features from raw image data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.
- **Parameter Sharing**: Convolutional layers share weights across spatial dimensions, reducing the number of parameters and enhancing computational efficiency.
- **Translation Invariance**: CNNs can recognize objects regardless of their position in the image.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling large and complex datasets effectively.

### 🔄 Applications of CNNs

- **Image Classification**: Categorizing images into predefined classes (e.g., cats vs. dogs).
- **Object Detection**: Identifying and localizing multiple objects within an image.
- **Image Segmentation**: Partitioning an image into meaningful regions or segments.
- **Facial Recognition**: Identifying and verifying individuals based on facial features.
- **Medical Imaging**: Diagnosing diseases by analyzing medical scans (e.g., MRI, CT).

### 🔗 Methods of Integration

#### 🧰 Using KerasClassifier

The `KerasClassifier` wrapper from `keras.wrappers.scikit_learn` allows you to integrate Keras (TensorFlow) CNN models within Scikit-Learn pipelines.

```python
from keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier

def create_cnn_model():
    from keras.models import Sequential
    from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32,32,3)))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2,2)))
    model.add(Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2,2)))
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.5))
    model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Wrap the model
cnn_classifier = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_cnn_model, epochs=10, batch_size=32, verbose=0)
```

#### 🧰 Custom Transformers

Create custom transformers by subclassing `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin` to include CNN components within Scikit-Learn pipelines.

```python
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin
from keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np

class CNNFeatureExtractor(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.model = load_model(model_path)
        self.model = Model(inputs=self.model.input, outputs=self.model.get_layer('dense').output)  # Example layer
    
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        return self
    
    def transform(self, X):
        features = self.model.predict(X)
        return features
```

### 📈 Building a Scikit-Learn Pipeline with CNNs

Integrate the CNN model within a Scikit-Learn pipeline by combining preprocessing steps, feature extraction, and classification.

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('cnn', cnn_classifier),
    ('svc', SVC())
])

param_grid = {
    'cnn__epochs': [10, 20],
    'cnn__batch_size': [32, 64],
    'svc__C': [0.1, 1, 10],
    'svc__kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']
}

grid = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=3, verbose=2)
```

*Note: Ensure that the CNN model is compatible with Scikit-Learn's pipeline requirements.*

# Load Dataset (Replace with CIFAR-10 or other image datasets)
digits = load_digits()
X = digits.images
y = digits.target

# Preprocess Data
X = np.expand_dims(X, -1)  # Add channel dimension
X = np.repeat(X, 3, axis=-1)  # Convert to RGB by repeating channels
X = X / 16.0  # Normalize

# Split Data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the Pipeline
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

```python
from keras.datasets import cifar10
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load CIFAR-10 Dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()

# Explore Dataset
print(f"Training Samples: {X_train.shape[0]}")
print(f"Test Samples: {X_test.shape[0]}")
print(f"Image Shape: {X_train[0].shape}")
print(f"Classes: {np.unique(y_train)}")

# Visualize Some Images
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 5, figsize=(15,6))
for ax, img, label in zip(axes.flatten(), X_train[:10], y_train[:10]):
    ax.imshow(img)
    ax.set_title(f"Class: {label[0]}")
    ax.axis('off')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

#### 2. Data Preprocessing

Preprocess the data by normalizing pixel values and expanding dimensions if necessary.

```python
# Normalize Pixel Values
X_train = X_train.astype('float32') / 255.0
X_test = X_test.astype('float32') / 255.0

# Convert Labels to 1D Array
y_train = y_train.flatten()
y_test = y_test.flatten()
```

#### 3. Building the CNN Model

Define a more complex CNN model suitable for CIFAR-10.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

def create_cifar10_cnn():
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', padding='same', input_shape=(32,32,3)))
    model.add(Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', padding='same'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2,2)))
    model.add(Dropout(0.25))
    
    model.add(Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu', padding='same'))
    model.add(Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu', padding='same'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2,2)))
    model.add(Dropout(0.25))
    
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.5))
    model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
    
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model
```

#### 4. Integrating the CNN with Scikit-Learn Pipeline

Wrap the CNN using `KerasClassifier` and create a pipeline.

```python
from keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Wrap the CNN Model
cnn_clf = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_cifar10_cnn, epochs=20, batch_size=64, verbose=1)

# Create a Pipeline (Example: Adding PCA - Not typical for CNNs but for demonstration)
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('cnn', cnn_clf)
])

# Define Parameter Grid
param_grid = {
    'cnn__epochs': [10, 20],
    'cnn__batch_size': [32, 64]
}

# Initialize Grid Search
grid = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=3, verbose=2)

# Note: GridSearchCV with CNNs can be time-consuming. Consider using fewer epochs or a subset of data.
```

#### 5. Training the Pipeline

cnn_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### 6. Evaluating the Model

Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset.

```python
# Predict on Test Data
y_pred = cnn_clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate Accuracy
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Classification Report
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Confusion Matrix
import seaborn as sns

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=range(10), yticklabels=range(10))
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('True')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```

#### 7. Hyperparameter Tuning

Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters using Grid Search.

```python
# Perform Grid Search
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Best Parameters
print(f"Best Parameters: {grid.best_params_}")

# Best Score
print(f"Best Cross-Validation Accuracy: {grid.best_score_:.2f}")

# Evaluate Best Model on Test Data
best_model = grid.best_estimator_
y_pred_best = best_model.predict(X_test)
accuracy_best = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_best)
print(f"Test Accuracy of Best Model: {accuracy_best:.2f}")
```

*Note: Hyperparameter tuning with deep learning models can be computationally intensive. Use appropriate resources or cloud services if necessary.*
