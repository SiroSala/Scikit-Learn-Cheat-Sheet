## 3. 🧠 Introduction to Image Classification 🧠

### 📚 What is Image Classification?

**Image Classification** is the process of assigning one or more predefined labels to an image. It involves analyzing the visual content of an image and determining the category it belongs to based on learned patterns and features. This task is fundamental in computer vision and serves as the building block for more complex applications like object detection, segmentation, and image generation.

**Example:**

- **Input Image**: A photo of a cat.
- **Assigned Label**: "Cat"

### 🔍 Importance of Image Classification in Machine Learning

- **Automation**: Enables automated sorting and categorization of visual data, reducing the need for manual intervention.
- **Efficiency**: Enhances the speed and accuracy of data processing in applications like medical imaging, surveillance, and retail.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates the handling of large volumes of image data efficiently.
- **Foundation for Advanced Tasks**: Serves as a stepping stone for more sophisticated computer vision tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and facial recognition.

### 🔄 Applications of Image Classification

- **Healthcare**: Diagnosing diseases from medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs).
- **Security**: Facial recognition systems in surveillance and access control.
- **Automotive**: Autonomous vehicles identifying road signs and obstacles.
- **Retail**: Inventory management through automated product recognition.
- **Agriculture**: Monitoring crop health and detecting pests via drone imagery.
- **Social Media**: Organizing and tagging user-uploaded photos.

## 4. 🛠️ Techniques for Image Classification with Scikit-Learn 🛠️

### 📊 Feature Extraction from Images

Before feeding images into machine learning models, it's essential to extract meaningful features that represent the visual content.

#### 🖼️ Flattening Images

Converting a 2D image into a 1D feature vector by flattening the pixel values.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits

# Load Dataset
digits = load_digits()
X = digits.images
y = digits.target

# Flatten Images
n_samples = len(X)
X_flat = X.reshape((n_samples, -1))
print(X_flat.shape)  # (1797, 64)
```

#### 🔡 Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

HOG is a feature descriptor that captures edge and gradient structures, making it effective for object detection and image classification.

```python
from skimage.feature import hog
from skimage import exposure

# Extract HOG Features for a Single Image
image = X[0]
fd, hog_image = hog(image, orientations=8, pixels_per_cell=(4, 4),
                    cells_per_block=(1, 1), visualize=True, multichannel=False)

# Display HOG Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8,4))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(image, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Original Image')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.imshow(hog_image, cmap='gray')
plt.title('HOG Image')
plt.show()
```

### 🧰 Dimensionality Reduction

Reducing the number of features to simplify the model and reduce computational cost while preserving essential information.

#### 📉 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA transforms the feature space to a lower-dimensional space by identifying the directions (principal components) that maximize variance.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Apply PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=0.95, whiten=True, random_state=42)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_flat)
print(f"Original number of features: {X_flat.shape[1]}")
print(f"Reduced number of features: {X_pca.shape[1]}")
```

### 📈 Building Image Classification Models

After feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, the processed data can be fed into various machine learning models.

#### 🧠 Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVMs are effective for high-dimensional spaces and are widely used in image classification tasks.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Initialize SVM Classifier
svm = SVC(kernel='linear', class_weight='balanced', random_state=42)

# Train the Model
svm.fit(X_pca, y)
```

#### 🌲 Decision Trees and Random Forests

Decision Trees are simple yet powerful classifiers, and Random Forests enhance their performance by averaging multiple trees.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Initialize Random Forest Classifier
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the Model
rf.fit(X_pca, y)
```

#### 🪄 k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

k-NN is a non-parametric method that classifies based on the majority label among the nearest neighbors.

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Initialize k-NN Classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

# Train the Model
knn.fit(X_pca, y)
```

## 5. 🛠️ Implementing Image Classification with Scikit-Learn 🛠️

### 🔡 Loading and Exploring the Dataset 🔡

We'll use the **Digits** dataset from Scikit-Learn, which contains images of handwritten digits.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load Dataset
digits = load_digits()
X = digits.images
y = digits.target

# Explore Dataset
print(f"Number of samples: {len(X)}")
print(f"Image shape: {X[0].shape}")
print(f"Labels: {np.unique(y)}")

# Visualize Some Digits
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 5, figsize=(10,5))
for ax, img, label in zip(axes.flatten(), X, y):
    ax.imshow(img, cmap='gray')
    ax.set_title(f"Label: {label}")
    ax.axis('off')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### 📊 Feature Extraction Example 📊

Extract HOG features for the entire dataset.

```python
from skimage.feature import hog
import numpy as np

# Function to Extract HOG Features
def extract_hog_features(images):
    hog_features = []
    for image in images:
        fd = hog(image, orientations=9, pixels_per_cell=(4, 4),
                 cells_per_block=(2, 2), block_norm='L2-Hys', visualize=False)
        hog_features.append(fd)
    return np.array(hog_features)

# Extract HOG Features
X_hog = extract_hog_features(X)
print(f"HOG feature shape: {X_hog.shape}")
```

### 🧰 Building and Training the Model 🧰

Build a machine learning pipeline combining PCA and SVM.

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

# Create a Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('pca', PCA(n_components=0.95, whiten=True, random_state=42)),
    ('svm', SVC(kernel='linear', class_weight='balanced', random_state=42))
])

# Train the Pipeline
pipeline.fit(X_hog, y)
```

### 📈 Evaluating the Model 📈

Assess the model's performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Predict on Training Data
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_hog)

# Calculate Accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y, y_pred)
print(f"Training Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Confusion Matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y, y_pred)
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(cm)

# Classification Report
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y, y_pred))
```

### 🪄 Hyperparameter Tuning 🪄

Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters using Grid Search.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define Parameter Grid
param_grid = {
    'pca__n_components': [0.90, 0.95, 0.99],
    'svm__C': [0.1, 1, 10],
    'svm__kernel': ['linear', 'rbf']
}

# Initialize Grid Search
grid = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy', n_jobs=-1)

# Perform Grid Search
grid.fit(X_hog, y)

# Best Parameters
print(f"Best Parameters: {grid.best_params_}")

# Best Score
print(f"Best Cross-Validation Accuracy: {grid.best_score_:.2f}")
```
