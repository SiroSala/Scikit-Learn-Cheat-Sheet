## 2. 🧠 Introduction to Deep Learning

Deep Learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, enabling breakthroughs in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. Let's delve into the basics to understand how it works.

### 🔍 What is Deep Learning?

**Deep Learning** is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to model and understand complex patterns in data. Unlike traditional machine learning models, deep learning models automatically discover representations from data without manual feature extraction.

### 🧩 Neural Networks Basics

A **Neural Network** is a series of algorithms that attempt to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Define a simple neural network
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Summary of the model
model.summary()
```

**Key Components:**
- **Layers**: Building blocks of neural networks (e.g., Dense, Convolutional).
- **Neurons**: Units within layers that process input data.
- **Weights and Biases**: Parameters that are learned during training.
- **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity into the network.

### 📦 TensorFlow Overview

**TensorFlow** is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem for building and deploying machine learning models.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Check TensorFlow version
print(tf.__version__)

# Create a constant tensor
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
print(hello)
```

**Features:**
- **Flexibility**: Supports both high-level APIs (Keras) and low-level operations.
- **Scalability**: Can run on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.
- **Community and Support**: Extensive documentation and active community contributions.

### 🛠️ Building Models with Keras

**Keras** is a high-level API for building and training deep learning models, integrated within TensorFlow.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Initialize the model
model = Sequential()

# Add layers
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu', input_dim=20))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Summary of the model
model.summary()
```

**Advantages of Keras:**
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive API.
- **Modular**: Easily add, remove, or modify layers.
- **Extensible**: Supports custom layers and functions.

### ⚡ Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Activation

# Example of different activation functions
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, input_shape=(100,)),
    Activation('relu'),  # Rectified Linear Unit
    Dense(10),
    Activation('softmax')  # Softmax for multi-class classification
])
```

**Common Activation Functions:**
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: `relu`
- **Sigmoid**: `sigmoid`
- **Tanh**: `tanh`
- **Softmax**: `softmax` (for multi-class classification)

### 📈 Training Neural Networks

Training involves adjusting the network's weights and biases to minimize the loss function.

```python
# Assuming X_train and y_train are prepared

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                    epochs=50,
                    batch_size=32,
                    validation_split=0.2)
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Epochs**: Number of complete passes through the training dataset.
- **Batch Size**: Number of samples processed before the model is updated.
- **Validation Split**: Portion of data used to validate the model's performance.

## 3. 📊 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are specialized neural networks designed for processing structured grid data like images. They excel in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define a CNN model
cnn_model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Assuming 10 classes
])

# Compile the model
cnn_model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

# Summary of the model
cnn_model.summary()
```

**Key Components:**
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from input data.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions and computational load.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Perform classification based on extracted features.

## 4. 🔄 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are designed for sequential data, making them ideal for tasks like language modeling, time series forecasting, and speech recognition.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense

# Define an RNN model
rnn_model = Sequential([
    SimpleRNN(50, activation='tanh', input_shape=(100, 1)),
    Dense(1, activation='linear')
])

# Compile the model
rnn_model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='mean_squared_error',
                  metrics=['mae'])

# Summary of the model
rnn_model.summary()
```

**Key Components:**
- **Recurrent Layers**: Maintain a hidden state to capture information from previous time steps.
- **LSTM and GRU**: Advanced RNN architectures that address the vanishing gradient problem.

---

## 5. 🧠 Transfer Learning

**Transfer Learning** leverages pre-trained models on large datasets and fine-tunes them for specific tasks, significantly reducing training time and improving performance, especially when limited data is available.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten

# Load the VGG16 model without the top classification layers
base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(64, 64, 3))

# Freeze the base model
base_model.trainable = False

# Create a new model on top
model = Sequential([
    base_model,
    Flatten(),
    Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Assuming 10 classes
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Summary of the model
model.summary()
```

**Advantages:**
- **Reduced Training Time**: Utilize pre-trained weights.
- **Improved Performance**: Benefit from knowledge learned from large datasets.
- **Less Data Required**: Effective even with smaller datasets.

# Normalize pixel values
X_train = X_train.astype('float32') / 255
X_test = X_test.astype('float32') / 255

# One-hot encode labels
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, 10)
