## 2. 🤖 Advanced Machine Learning Techniques 📈

Building upon the basics of machine learning, today we'll explore advanced algorithms that can handle more complex data patterns and improve prediction accuracy.

### 🌳🦁 Decision Trees and Random Forests

**Decision Trees** are intuitive models that split data based on feature values to make predictions. **Random Forests** enhance decision trees by combining multiple trees to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Decision Tree
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_dt = dt.predict(X_test)
print("Decision Tree Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_dt))

# Random Forest
rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_rf = rf.predict(X_test)
print("Random Forest Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_rf))
```

### 🔧⚙️ Support Vector Machines (SVM)

**Support Vector Machines** are powerful classifiers that find the optimal hyperplane separating different classes by maximizing the margin between them.

```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Initialize SVM with linear kernel
svm = SVC(kernel='linear', random_state=42)
svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_svm = svm.predict(X_test)
print("SVM Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_svm))
```

### 👫👬 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**K-Nearest Neighbors** is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among their nearest neighbors.

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Initialize KNN with k=3
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_knn = knn.predict(X_test)
print("KNN Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_knn))
```

### 📉🔥 Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

**Gradient Boosting Machines** build models sequentially, each new model correcting the errors of the previous ones. They are highly effective for both classification and regression tasks.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

# Initialize GBM
gbm = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=42)
gbm.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_gbm = gbm.predict(X_test)
print("Gradient Boosting Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_gbm))
```

---

## 3. 📊 Model Evaluation and Selection 🔍

Evaluating and selecting the right model is crucial for achieving high performance and reliability in your machine learning projects.

### 🔄 Cross-Validation

**Cross-Validation** is a technique to assess how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent dataset. It is mainly used to prevent overfitting.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Initialize model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Perform 5-fold cross-validation
cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
print("Cross-Validation Scores:", cv_scores)
print("Average CV Accuracy:", cv_scores.mean())
```

### 📈📉 Confusion Matrix and Classification Metrics

**Confusion Matrix** provides a summary of prediction results, showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions broken down by each class.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Generate confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_rf)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", cm)

# Classification report
cr = classification_report(y_test, y_pred_rf)
print("Classification Report:\n", cr)
```

### 📈🔺 ROC Curve and AUC

**Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve** illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. **Area Under the Curve (AUC)** measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the ROC curve.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# For binary classification, adjust accordingly
# Here, we'll use one-vs-rest for multi-class
from sklearn.preprocessing import label_binarize
import numpy as np

# Binarize the output
y_binary = label_binarize(y, classes=[0, 1, 2])
n_classes = y_binary.shape[1]

# Fit the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_score = model.predict_proba(X_test)

# Compute ROC curve and ROC area for each class
fpr = dict()
tpr = dict()
roc_auc = dict()
for i in range(n_classes):
    fpr[i], tpr[i], _ = roc_curve(y_test == i, y_score[:, i])
    roc_auc[i] = auc(fpr[i], tpr[i])

# Plot ROC curves
plt.figure()
colors = ['blue', 'red', 'green']
for i, color in zip(range(n_classes), colors):
    plt.plot(fpr[i], tpr[i], color=color, lw=2,
             label='ROC curve of class {0} (area = {1:0.2f})'
             ''.format(i, roc_auc[i]))

plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], 'k--', lw=2)
plt.xlim([-0.01, 1.0])
plt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve')
plt.legend(loc="lower right")
plt.show()
```

## 4. 🔧 Feature Engineering 🛠️

**Feature Engineering** involves creating new input features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance. It plays a critical role in the success of machine learning models.

### 🔡 Handling Categorical Variables

Converting categorical variables into numerical form is essential for most machine learning algorithms.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'New York', 'Chicago']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# One-Hot Encoding
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
encoded = encoder.fit_transform(df[['City']])
encoded_df = pd.DataFrame(encoded, columns=encoder.get_feature_names_out(['City']))
df = pd.concat([df, encoded_df], axis=1)
print(df)
```

### 📏🔄 Feature Scaling and Transformation

Scaling features ensures that all variables contribute equally to the result, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler

# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Height': [150, 160, 170, 180, 190],
    'Weight': [50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Standardization
scaler = StandardScaler()
df[['Height_Scaled', 'Weight_Scaled']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['Height', 'Weight']])
print(df)

# Min-Max Scaling
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
df[['Height_MinMax', 'Weight_MinMax']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['Height', 'Weight']])
print(df)
```

### ✨ Creating New Features

Generating new features from existing data can provide additional insights and improve model performance.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Date': pd.date_range(start='1/1/2020', periods=5, freq='D'),
    'Sales': [200, 220, 250, 275, 300]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Extracting Date Features
df['Day'] = df['Date'].dt.day
df['Month'] = df['Date'].dt.month
df['Weekday'] = df['Date'].dt.weekday
print(df)

# Creating Interaction Features
df['Sales_Per_Day'] = df['Sales'] / df['Day']
print(df)
```

## 5. 📦 Introduction to Model Deployment 🚀

Deploying machine learning models allows you to integrate them into applications and make real-time predictions.

### 💾📂 Saving and Loading Models

Persisting models enables you to reuse them without retraining.

```python
import joblib
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Sample Model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Saving the model
joblib.dump(model, 'random_forest_model.pkl')

# Loading the model
loaded_model = joblib.load('random_forest_model.pkl')
y_pred_loaded = loaded_model.predict(X_test)
print("Loaded Model Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_loaded))
```

### ⚙️🌐 Deploying Models with Flask

**Flask** is a lightweight web framework that can be used to deploy machine learning models as web services.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import joblib
import numpy as np

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('random_forest_model.pkl')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    # Assume input features are sent in a list
    prediction = model.predict([np.array(data['features'])])
    return jsonify({'prediction': int(prediction[0])})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', scaler, iris.feature_names)
        # ('cat', onehot, categorical_features)
    ])

# Feature Engineering: Creating interaction terms
def add_interaction_features(X):
    X['sepal_length_sepal_width'] = X['sepal length (cm)'] * X['sepal width (cm)']
    X['petal_length_petal_width'] = X['petal length (cm)'] * X['petal width (cm)']
    return X

# Create a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[
