    detections = postprocess_predictions(predictions)
    
    # Initialize Trackers for New Detections
    for det in detections:
        box, score, cls = det
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = box
        bbox = (x1, y1, x2 - x1, y2 - y1)
        initialize_tracker(frame, bbox)
    
    # Update Trackers and Draw Bounding Boxes
    for obj_id, trk in list(object_trackers.items()):
        success, bbox = trk.update(frame)
        if success:
            x, y, w, h = [int(v) for v in bbox]
            cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (255,0,0), 2)
            cv2.putText(frame, f"ID: {obj_id}", (x, y - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (255,0,0), 2)
            disappeared[obj_id] = 0

### 📈 Project 3: Image Captioning with CNNs and RNNs 📈

#### 📋 Project Overview

**Objective**: Develop an image captioning system that generates descriptive captions for images by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence generation.

**Tools**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-Learn, OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy

#### 📝 Step-by-Step Guide

##### 1. Preparing the Dataset

Use the Flickr8k dataset, which contains images paired with descriptive captions.

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

# Define Dataset Paths
dataset_path = 'path_to_flickr8k_dataset'
images_path = os.path.join(dataset_path, 'Images')
captions_file = os.path.join(dataset_path, 'captions.txt')

# Load Captions
captions_df = pd.read_csv(captions_file, sep='\t', header=None, names=['image', 'caption'])
print(captions_df.head())

# Display Some Captions
for i in range(5):
    img = captions_df.iloc[i]['image']
    caption = captions_df.iloc[i]['caption']
    print(f"Image: {img}, Caption: {caption}")
```

##### 2. Building the CNN Encoder

Use a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16) to extract image features.

```python
from keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16, preprocess_input
from keras.models import Model
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Load Pre-trained VGG16 Model + Higher Level Layers
base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet')
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=base_model.get_layer('fc1').output)

# Function to Extract Features from an Image
def extract_features(img_path, model, target_size=(224, 224)):
    img = cv2.imread(img_path)
    img = cv2.resize(img, target_size)
    img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    img = preprocess_input(img)
    img = np.expand_dims(img, axis=0)
    features = model.predict(img, verbose=0)
    return features.flatten()
```

##### 3. Building the RNN Decoder

Define an RNN model (e.g., LSTM) to generate captions based on CNN-extracted features.

```python
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Add

# Define the RNN Decoder
def create_captioning_model(vocab_size, max_length, embedding_dim=256, units=512):
    # Feature Input
    features_input = Input(shape=(4096,))
    features_dense = Dense(units, activation='relu')(features_input)
    
    # Caption Input
    caption_input = Input(shape=(max_length,))
    embedding = Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim, mask_zero=True)(caption_input)
    lstm = LSTM(units, return_sequences=True)(embedding)
    
    # Merge Features and Captions
    merged = Add()([features_dense, lstm])
    outputs = Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')(merged)
    
    # Define the Model
    model = Model(inputs=[features_input, caption_input], outputs=outputs)
    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
    return model

# Example Usage
vocab_size = 5000  # Example vocabulary size
max_length = 34    # Example maximum caption length
caption_model = create_captioning_model(vocab_size, max_length)
caption_model.summary()
```

##### 4. Integrating Encoder and Decoder

Combine the CNN encoder and RNN decoder into an end-to-end image captioning system.

```python
# Function to Generate a Caption for an Image
def generate_caption(image_path, model, encoder_model, tokenizer, max_length):
    # Extract Features
    features = extract_features(image_path, encoder_model)
    
    # Initialize Caption
    caption = 'startseq'
    
    for _ in range(max_length):
        # Convert Caption to Sequence
        sequence = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([caption])[0]
        sequence = pad_sequences([sequence], maxlen=max_length)
        
        # Predict Next Word
        yhat = model.predict([np.array([features]), np.array(sequence)], verbose=0)
        yhat = np.argmax(yhat)
        
        # Convert Index to Word
        word = tokenizer.index_word.get(yhat, None)
        if word is None:
            break
        caption += ' ' + word
        if word == 'endseq':
            break
    
    # Remove Start and End Tokens
    final_caption = caption.split()[1:-1]
    final_caption = ' '.join(final_caption)
    return final_caption

# Example Usage
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=vocab_size)
# Fit tokenizer on captions...

image_path = 'path_to_image.jpg'
generated_caption = generate_caption(image_path, caption_model, model, tokenizer, max_length)
print(f"Generated Caption: {generated_caption}")
```

##### 5. Training the Image Captioning Model

Train the combined CNN-RNN model using the prepared dataset.

```python
# Example Training Loop (Simplified)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for img, caption in data_generator:
        features = extract_features(os.path.join(images_path, img), model)
        # Convert caption to sequence
        seq = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([caption])[0]
        # Split into input and output pairs
        for i in range(1, len(seq)):
            in_seq, out_seq = seq[:i], seq[i]
            in_seq = pad_sequences([in_seq], maxlen=max_length)[0]
            out_seq = to_categorical([out_seq], num_classes=vocab_size)[0]
            # Train the model
            caption_model.train_on_batch([features, in_seq], out_seq)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1} completed.")
```

##### 6. Generating Captions for New Images

Use the trained model to generate captions for unseen images.

```python
# Generate Caption for a New Image
new_image_path = 'path_to_new_image.jpg'
caption = generate_caption(new_image_path, caption_model, model, tokenizer, max_length)
print(f"Generated Caption: {caption}")

# Display Image with Caption
image = cv2.imread(new_image_path)
image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
plt.imshow(image)
plt.title(caption)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

#### 📊 Results and Insights

The image captioning system successfully generates descriptive captions for new images by leveraging the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs and the sequence generation strengths of RNNs.
