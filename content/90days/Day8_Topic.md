## 2. 🗃️ Introduction to Big Data Tools 🗃️

Big Data refers to datasets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate. To handle such data, specialized tools and frameworks have been developed.

### 🔍 What is Big Data? 🔍

**Big Data** is characterized by the "4 Vs":

- **Volume**: Massive amounts of data generated every second.
- **Velocity**: High speed at which new data is generated and moves around.
- **Variety**: Different types of data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured).
- **Veracity**: Uncertainty or trustworthiness of the data.

### 🐘 Hadoop Overview 🐘

**Hadoop** is an open-source framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.

**Key Components:**

- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**: Stores data across multiple machines.
- **MapReduce**: A programming model for processing large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm.
- **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**: Manages and schedules resources in the Hadoop cluster.
- **Hive**: Data warehouse software that facilitates querying and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage.
- **Pig**: A high-level platform for creating programs that run on Hadoop.

**Basic HDFS Commands:**

```bash
# List files in HDFS directory
hdfs dfs -ls /user/data

# Put a local file into HDFS
hdfs dfs -put localfile.txt /user/data/

# Get a file from HDFS to local filesystem
hdfs dfs -get /user/data/file.txt ./localfile.txt

# Remove a file from HDFS
hdfs dfs -rm /user/data/file.txt
```

### ⚡ Apache Spark Basics ⚡

**Apache Spark** is a fast, in-memory data processing engine with elegant and expressive development APIs for large-scale data processing.

**Key Features:**

- **Speed**: Processes data in memory, making it up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce.
- **Ease of Use**: Provides APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Supports SQL queries, streaming data, machine learning, and graph processing.

**Spark Components:**

- **Spark Core**: The foundation of Spark, providing basic I/O functionalities.
- **Spark SQL**: Module for structured data processing.
- **Spark Streaming**: Enables processing of live data streams.
- **MLlib**: Machine learning library.
- **GraphX**: API for graphs and graph-parallel computation.

### 🐍 Data Processing with PySpark 🐍

**PySpark** is the Python API for Spark, allowing Python developers to harness the simplicity of Python and the power of Apache Spark.

**Basic PySpark Operations:**

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("BigDataExample") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Load data into DataFrame
df = spark.read.csv("hdfs:///user/data/large_dataset.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Show the first few rows
df.show(5)

# Perform a simple transformation
df_filtered = df.filter(df['age'] > 30)

# Show the filtered data
df_filtered.show(5)

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
```

### 🗄️ Introduction to NoSQL Databases 🗄️

**NoSQL** databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data, providing flexibility and scalability beyond traditional relational databases.

**Types of NoSQL Databases:**

- **Document Stores**: Store data in JSON-like documents (e.g., MongoDB).
- **Key-Value Stores**: Store data as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis).
- **Column Stores**: Store data in columns rather than rows (e.g., Cassandra).
- **Graph Databases**: Store data in graph structures with nodes and edges (e.g., Neo4j).

**Example: Basic MongoDB Operations**

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")

# Select database and collection
db = client["BigDataDB"]
collection = db["Employees"]

# Insert a document
employee = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 28, "department": "Sales"}
collection.insert_one(employee)

# Find a document
result = collection.find_one({"name": "John Doe"})
print(result)

# Update a document
collection.update_one({"name": "John Doe"}, {"$set": {"age": 29}})

# Delete a document
collection.delete_one({"name": "John Doe"})
```

## 3. 🛠️📈 Example Project: Analyzing Large Datasets with Spark 🛠️📈

Let's apply today's concepts by analyzing a large dataset using Apache Spark and PySpark. We'll process and analyze a simulated large-scale e-commerce dataset to derive valuable business insights.

### 📋 Project Overview

**Objective**: Analyze a large e-commerce dataset to uncover patterns in sales, customer behavior, and product performance.

**Tools**: Apache Spark, PySpark, Jupyter Notebook, HDFS

### 📝 Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Set Up Spark Environment

Ensure that Apache Spark is installed and configured on your system or cluster. You can also use cloud-based services like Databricks for an interactive environment.

#### 2. Initialize Spark Session

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("ECommerceAnalysis") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

#### 3. Load the Dataset

Assume we have a large CSV file stored in HDFS.

```python
# Load data into DataFrame
df = spark.read.csv("hdfs:///user/data/ecommerce_large.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Display schema
df.printSchema()

# Show first few rows
df.show(5)
```

#### 4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Remove rows with null values in important columns
df_cleaned = df.dropna(subset=["order_id", "customer_id", "product_id", "quantity", "price"])

# Convert data types if necessary
df_cleaned = df_cleaned.withColumn("quantity", col("quantity").cast("integer")) \
                       .withColumn("price", col("price").cast("float"))
```

#### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis

```python
# Calculate total sales
total_sales = df_cleaned.groupBy().sum("quantity", "price").collect()[0]
print(f"Total Quantity Sold: {total_sales['sum(quantity)']}")
print(f"Total Sales Revenue: {total_sales['sum(price)'] * total_sales['sum(quantity)']}")

# Top 5 products by sales
top_products = df_cleaned.groupBy("product_id") \
                         .sum("quantity") \
                         .orderBy(col("sum(quantity)").desc()) \
                         .limit(5)
top_products.show()

# Sales by region
sales_by_region = df_cleaned.groupBy("region") \
                            .sum("quantity", "price") \
                            .orderBy(col("sum(price)").desc())
sales_by_region.show()
```

#### 6. Machine Learning with Spark MLlib

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.clustering import KMeans

# Prepare data for clustering
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["quantity", "price"], outputCol="features")
df_features = assembler.transform(df_cleaned)

# Apply K-Means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(k=3, seed=1)
model = kmeans.fit(df_features.select("features"))

# Make predictions
predictions = model.transform(df_features)

# Show cluster centers
centers = model.clusterCenters()
print("Cluster Centers: ")
for center in centers:
    print(center)

# Show some predictions
predictions.select("order_id", "product_id", "quantity", "price", "prediction").show(5)
```

#### 7. Save Results Back to HDFS

```python
# Save top products to HDFS
top_products.write.csv("hdfs:///user/data/top_products.csv", header=True)

# Save sales by region to HDFS
sales_by_region.write.csv("hdfs:///user/data/sales_by_region.csv", header=True)
```

#### 8. Stop Spark Session

```python
spark.stop()
```
