## 1. Introduction to Python

Python is a versatile and widely used programming language, especially popular in the field of data science due to its readability, simplicity, and the extensive ecosystem of data-focused libraries.

### Why Python for Data Science?

- **Simplicity & Readability**: Python's syntax is clean and its commands mimic the English language, which makes it an ideal choice for beginners in programming.
- **Extensive Libraries**: Libraries like pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib make data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization straightforward.
- **Community & Support**: A vast community of developers and data scientists ensures that Python remains cutting-edge and supportive.

## 2. Python Basics

### Data Types

Python handles a variety of data types. Here's an overview and some examples:

```python
# Integers
x = 5

# Floating point
y = 3.14

# Strings
z = 'Hello Data Science'

# Boolean
a = True
b = False

# None Type
c = None
```

### Control Structures

Control structures in Python direct the flow of your code. Below are examples of `if`, `for`, and `while` loops:

```python
# If statement
if x > 4:
    print('x is greater than 4')

# For loop on a range
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# While loop
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
```

## 3. Introduction to Pandas

Pandas is a cornerstone library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

### Series and DataFrames

Pandas has two primary data structures:
- **Series**: A one-dimensional array-like object.
- **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a Series
s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])

# Creating a DataFrame
data = {'Product': ['Widget A', 'Widget B'], 'Price': [25.50, 45.75]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

## 4. Data Manipulation with Pandas

### Filtering

Filtering data is straightforward with pandas:

```python
# Creating a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'age': [25, 30, 35]
})

# Filtering
adults = df[df['age'] >= 30]
print(adults)
```

### Aggregation

Pandas provides several methods to perform aggregations:

```python
# Summing data
total_age = df['age'].sum()
print('Total Age:', total_age)
```

## 5. Introduction to Data Visualization

Visualization is key in data science to understand the data and to communicate findings effectively.

### Matplotlib Basics

Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python which provides a variety of plot types.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Line plot
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [1, 4, 9, 16, 25])
plt.show()
```

### Seaborn for Statistical Plots

Seaborn builds on Matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures.

```python
import seaborn as sns

# Load an example dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')

# Create a bar plot
sns.barplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips)
plt.show()
```

## 6. Example Project: Analyzing a Dataset

Letâ€™s apply what we've learned to a real dataset:

```python
# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Display first 5 rows
print(data.head())

# Basic statistics
print(data.describe())

# Visualization
sns.histplot(data['price'])
plt.show()
```

## 7. Conclusion and Next Steps

Congratulations on completing Day 1! You've taken your first steps into Data Science with Python. Continue practicing these concepts and explore more complex analyses and datasets.
