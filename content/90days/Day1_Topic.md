## 1. 🌟 Welcome to Day 1

Welcome to **Day 1** of your 90-day journey to becoming a Scikit-Learn boss! Today, we'll lay the foundation by introducing Scikit-Learn, setting up your development environment, understanding its core API, performing basic data preprocessing, building your first machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.

---

## 2. 🔍 What is Scikit-Learn? 🔍

**Scikit-Learn** is one of the most popular open-source machine learning libraries for Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

**Key Features:**

- **Wide Range of Algorithms**: Classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more.
- **Consistent API**: Makes it easy to switch between different models.
- **Integration with Other Libraries**: Works seamlessly with pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started.

---

## 3. 🛠️ Setting Up Your Environment 🛠️

Before diving into Scikit-Learn, ensure your development environment is properly set up.

### 📦 Installing Scikit-Learn 📦

You can install Scikit-Learn using `pip` or `conda`.

**Using pip:**
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

**Using conda:**
```bash
conda install scikit-learn
```

### 💻 Setting Up a Virtual Environment 💻

Creating a virtual environment helps manage dependencies and keep your projects organized.

**Using `venv`:**
```bash
# Create a virtual environment named 'env'
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
env\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source env/bin/activate
```

**Using `conda`:**
```bash
# Create a conda environment named 'ml_env'
conda create -n ml_env python=3.8

# Activate the environment
conda activate ml_env
```

---

## 4. 🧩 Understanding Scikit-Learn's API 🧩

Scikit-Learn follows a consistent and intuitive API design, making it easy to implement various machine learning algorithms.

### 🔄 The Estimator API 🔄

In Scikit-Learn, most objects follow the **Estimator API**, which includes:

- **Estimator**: An object that learns from data (`fit` method).
- **Predictor**: An object that makes predictions (`predict` method).

### 📈 Fit and Predict Methods 📈

- **`fit(X, y)`**: Trains the model on the data.
- **`predict(X)`**: Makes predictions based on the trained model.

### 🔄 Pipelines 🔄

**Pipelines** allow you to chain multiple processing steps, ensuring that all steps are applied consistently during training and prediction.

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Create a pipeline with scaling and logistic regression
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression())
])

# Train the pipeline
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = pipeline.predict(X_test)
```

---

## 5. 📊 Basic Data Preprocessing 📊

Data preprocessing is essential to prepare your data for machine learning models.

### 🧹 Handling Missing Values 🧹

Missing values can adversely affect model performance. Scikit-Learn provides tools to handle them.

```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Age': [25, None, 35, 40],
    'Salary': [50000, 60000, None, 80000]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Impute missing values with mean
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
df[['Age', 'Salary']] = imputer.fit_transform(df[['Age', 'Salary']])
print(df)
```

### 🔡 Encoding Categorical Variables 🔡

Machine learning models require numerical input. Convert categorical variables using encoding techniques.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'New York']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# One-Hot Encoding
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
encoded = encoder.fit_transform(df[['City']])
encoded_df = pd.DataFrame(encoded, columns=encoder.get_feature_names_out(['City']))
df = pd.concat([df, encoded_df], axis=1)
print(df)
```

### 📏 Feature Scaling 📏

Scaling features ensures that all variables contribute equally to the result.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Height': [150, 160, 170, 180, 190],
    'Weight': [50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Standardization
scaler = StandardScaler()
df[['Height_Scaled', 'Weight_Scaled']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['Height', 'Weight']])
print(df)
```

---

## 6. 🤖 Building Your First Model 🤖

Let's build a simple classification model using the Iris dataset.

### 📚 Loading a Dataset 📚

Scikit-Learn provides easy access to common datasets.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import pandas as pd

# Load Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
y = pd.Series(iris.target, name='Species')
```

### 🛠️ Splitting the Data 🛠️

Divide the data into training and testing sets.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### 📈 Training a Simple Classifier 📈

We'll use a Logistic Regression classifier.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Initialize the model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 📉 Making Predictions 📉

Use the trained model to make predictions.

```python
# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(predictions)
```

---

## 7. 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics 📈

Evaluate the performance of your model using various metrics.

### ✅ Accuracy ✅

Measures the proportion of correct predictions.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

### 📏 Precision, Recall, and F1-Score 📏

Provide more insight into model performance, especially for imbalanced datasets.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

report = classification_report(y_test, predictions, target_names=iris.target_names)
print(report)
```

### 🔍 Confusion Matrix 🔍

Visualizes the performance of a classification model.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=iris.target_names, yticklabels=iris.target_names)
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
```
