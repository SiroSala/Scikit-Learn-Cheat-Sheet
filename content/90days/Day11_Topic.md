## 4. 🛠️ NLP Techniques with Scikit-Learn 🛠️

### 🔡 Text Preprocessing

Effective text preprocessing is crucial for preparing raw text data for analysis and modeling. It involves several steps:

#### 📄 Tokenization

Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

text = ["Hello world! Welcome to NLP."]
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
tokens = vectorizer.build_tokenizer()(text[0])
print(tokens)
```

#### 🧹 Stop Words Removal

Eliminating common words that do not contribute significant meaning to the text (e.g., "the", "is", "and").

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

text = ["This is a sample sentence with stop words."]
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(text)
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
```

#### ✂️ Stemming and Lemmatization

Reducing words to their base or root form.

- **Stemming**: Trims word suffixes (e.g., "running" → "run").
- **Lemmatization**: Converts words to their dictionary form (e.g., "better" → "good").

*Note: Scikit-Learn does not provide built-in stemming or lemmatization. Use libraries like NLTK or spaCy for these tasks.*

```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

text = "running runners ran easily"
ps = PorterStemmer()
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
stemmed = [ps.stem(word) for word in tokens]
print(stemmed)
```

### 📊 Feature Extraction

Transforming text data into numerical representations that machine learning models can process.

#### 👜 Bag of Words (BoW)

Represents text as the frequency of words appearing in the document.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

corpus = [
    "This is the first document.",
    "This document is the second document.",
    "And this is the third one.",
    "Is this the first document?"
]

vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print(X.toarray())
```

#### 📏 Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)

Measures the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire corpus.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

corpus = [
    "This is the first document.",
    "This document is the second document.",
    "And this is the third one.",
    "Is this the first document?"
]

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print(X.toarray())
```

#### 🔠 N-grams

Captures contiguous sequences of N items (words) in the text, enabling the model to understand context.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

corpus = [
    "This is the first document.",
    "This document is the second document.",
    "And this is the third one.",
    "Is this the first document?"
]

vectorizer = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2))
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print(X.toarray())
```

### 🧰 Text Vectorization with Scikit-Learn

#### 🔍 CountVectorizer

Converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

corpus = [
    "This is the first document.",
    "This document is the second document.",
    "And this is the third one.",
    "Is this the first document?"
]

vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
print(X.toarray())
```

#### 📈 TfidfVectorizer

Converts a collection of raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

corpus = [
    "This is the first document.",
    "This document is the second document.",
    "And this is the third one.",
    "Is this the first document?"
]

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
print(X.toarray())
```

**Tools**: Python, Scikit-Learn, pandas, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 📝 Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Load and Explore the Dataset

For this project, we'll use the **IMDB Movie Reviews** dataset, which contains labeled movie reviews.

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load Dataset
# Assume 'imdb_reviews.csv' has two columns: 'Review' and 'Sentiment' (1: Positive, 0: Negative)
df = pd.read_csv('imdb_reviews.csv')
print(df.head())

# Check class distribution
sns.countplot(x='Sentiment', data=df)
plt.title('Class Distribution')
plt.show()

# Display sample reviews
print(df.sample(5))
```

#### 2. Data Preprocessing

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
import nltk
import re

# Download NLTK data
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

# Initialize Lemmatizer and Stop Words
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Text Cleaning Function
def clean_text(text):
    # Remove HTML tags
    text = re.sub(r'<.*?>', '', text)
    # Remove non-letters
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', text)
    # Tokenize
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text.lower())
    # Remove stop words and lemmatize
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens if word not in stop_words]
    return ' '.join(tokens)

# Apply Cleaning
df['Cleaned_Review'] = df['Review'].apply(clean_text)
print(df[['Review', 'Cleaned_Review']].head())

# Split the Data
X = df['Cleaned_Review']
y = df['Sentiment']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

#### 3. Feature Extraction

We'll use `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text data into numerical features.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Initialize TfidfVectorizer
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000, ngram_range=(1,2))
X_train_tfidf = tfidf.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_tfidf = tfidf.transform(X_test)

print(X_train_tfidf.shape)
print(X_test_tfidf.shape)
```

#### 4. Building the Classification Model

We'll build a Logistic Regression model for sentiment classification.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Initialize Logistic Regression
lr = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)

# Train the Model
lr.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)
```

#### 5. Evaluating the Model

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, classification_report

# Make Predictions
y_pred = lr.predict(X_test_tfidf)

# Calculate Metrics
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
print(f"Precision: {precision:.2f}")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.2f}")
print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.2f}")

# Detailed Classification Report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

#### 6. Improving the Model

Experiment with different models and hyperparameters to enhance performance.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Initialize Random Forest Classifier
rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)

# Define Hyperparameter Grid
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5]
}

# Initialize GridSearchCV
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=rf, param_grid=param_grid, cv=3, scoring='f1', n_jobs=-1)

# Train with Grid Search
grid_search.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

# Best Parameters
print(f"Best Parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}")
