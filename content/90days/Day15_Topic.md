## 3. 🧠 Introduction to Advanced Text Generation and Transformers 🧠

### 📚 What are Transformers?

**Transformers** are a type of deep learning architecture introduced in the paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. They have become the foundation for many state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT, GPT, and T5. Unlike traditional models that process data sequentially, Transformers leverage the **self-attention mechanism** to process data in parallel, enabling efficient training and capturing long-range dependencies in text.

### 🔍 Understanding Attention Mechanism

The **attention mechanism** allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions. It enables the model to focus on relevant parts of the input text, improving the quality and coherence of generated text.

**Illustration of Attention Mechanism:**

*Image Source: [Medium](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*jKy6qZtl6YkPFVj3d3BSwA.gif)*

### 🔄 Applications of Transformer-Based Models

- **Text Generation**: Creating coherent and contextually relevant text, such as stories, articles, and dialogues.
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another with high accuracy.
- **Summarization**: Condensing long documents into concise summaries.
- **Question Answering**: Building systems that can answer questions based on provided text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding the sentiment expressed in text with greater nuance.

---

## 4. 🛠️ Techniques for Advanced Text Generation 🛠️

### 🤖 Transformer Architecture

Transformers consist of an **encoder** and a **decoder**, each composed of multiple layers. The encoder processes the input text, while the decoder generates the output text. Both components utilize self-attention and feed-forward neural networks to capture complex patterns in the data.

**Key Components:**

- **Self-Attention Layers**: Allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence.
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Process the attended information to generate representations.
- **Positional Encoding**: Inject information about the position of words in the sequence, since Transformers do not inherently understand word order.

### 🧠 Pre-trained Language Models

Pre-trained models are trained on large corpora of text and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. They save time and resources, as training from scratch is computationally expensive.

#### 🔍 BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

- **Purpose**: Designed for understanding the context of words in search queries.
- **Architecture**: Encoder-only model, focusing on bidirectional context.
- **Applications**: Question answering, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition.

#### 🔍 GPT Series (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

- **Purpose**: Primarily designed for text generation.
- **Architecture**: Decoder-only model, focusing on unidirectional context.
- **Applications**: Chatbots, automated content creation, code generation.

#### 🔍 T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) and Beyond

- **Purpose**: Treats every NLP problem as a text-to-text task.
- **Architecture**: Encoder-decoder model.
- **Applications**: Translation, summarization, classification, question answering.

### ⚙️ Fine-Tuning Pre-trained Models

Fine-tuning involves adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task by training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This process leverages the model's existing knowledge while tailoring it to perform optimally for the desired application.

---

## 5. 🛠️ Implementing Advanced Text Generation with Hugging Face Transformers 🛠️

To implement advanced text generation, we'll utilize the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library, which provides accessible interfaces to state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

### 🔡 Setting Up the Environment 🔡

First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can set up a virtual environment and install the required packages using `pip`.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Install required libraries
pip install transformers torch nltk pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### 🤖 Using GPT-2 for Text Generation 🤖

GPT-2 is a powerful language model capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text.

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer
model_name = 'gpt2'
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Set the model to evaluation mode
model.eval()

# Function to Generate Text
def generate_text(prompt, max_length=50):
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt')
    outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=max_length, num_return_sequences=1, no_repeat_ngram_size=2, early_stopping=True)
    text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return text

# Generate Text
prompt = "Once upon a time in a land far away"
generated = generate_text(prompt)
print(generated)
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Once upon a time in a land far away, there lived a young prince named Aric. He was brave and kind, loved by all in the kingdom. One day, a mysterious stranger arrived...
```

### 🔄 Fine-Tuning GPT-2 on Custom Data 🔄

Fine-tuning GPT-2 allows the model to adapt to specific styles or domains, enhancing its text generation capabilities.

```python
import pandas as pd
import torch
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer, TextDataset, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load and Prepare Dataset
def load_dataset(file_path, tokenizer, block_size=128):
    return TextDataset(
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        file_path=file_path,
        block_size=block_size
    )

# Prepare Training Data
train_dataset = load_dataset('custom_reviews.txt', tokenizer)

# Data Collator
data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False,
)

# Training Arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./gpt2-finetuned',
    overwrite_output_dir=True,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    save_steps=10_000,
    save_total_limit=2,
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
)

# Fine-Tune the Model
trainer.train()

# Save the Model
trainer.save_model('./gpt2-finetuned')
tokenizer.save_pretrained('./gpt2-finetuned')
```

*Note: Ensure `custom_reviews.txt` contains one review per line.*

### 🧰 Integrating with Scikit-Learn Pipelines 🧰

While Scikit-Learn doesn't natively support Transformer-based models, you can integrate them into pipelines using custom transformers.

```python
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

class GPT2TextGenerator(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self, model_name='gpt2', max_length=50):
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.max_length = max_length
        self.tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.model.eval()
    
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        return self
    
    def transform(self, X):
        generated_texts = []
        for prompt in X:
            inputs = self.tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt')
            outputs = self.model.generate(inputs, max_length=self.max_length, num_return_sequences=1, no_repeat_ngram_size=2, early_stopping=True)
            text = self.tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
            generated_texts.append(text)
        return generated_texts

# Example Usage
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('generate', GPT2TextGenerator(model_name='gpt2', max_length=30))
])

prompts = [
    "The future of AI in healthcare",
    "Advancements in renewable energy",
    "The impact of social media on society"
]

generated = pipeline.fit_transform(prompts)
for text in generated:
    print(text)
```

**Sample Output:**
```
The future of AI in healthcare is promising, with advancements in machine learning and data analytics revolutionizing patient care...
Advancements in renewable energy are crucial for sustainable development, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change...
The impact of social media on society is profound, influencing communication, information dissemination, and personal relationships...
```

## 6. 📈 Model Evaluation for Advanced Text Generation 📈

### 🧮 Perplexity and BLEU Scores 🧮

- **Perplexity**: Measures how well a probability model predicts a sample. Lower perplexity indicates better performance.
  
  ```python
  # Calculate Perplexity
  perplexity = model.perplexity(X_tfidf)
  print(f"Perplexity: {perplexity:.2f}")
  ```

- **BLEU Scores**: Evaluates the quality of generated text by comparing it to reference texts. Higher scores indicate better performance.
  
  ```python
  from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu
  
  reference = [['this', 'is', 'a', 'test']]
  candidate = ['this', 'is', 'a', 'test']
  bleu_score = sentence_bleu(reference, candidate)
  print(f"BLEU Score: {bleu_score:.2f}")
  ```

### 🔍 Human Evaluation 🔍

Human evaluation involves qualitative assessment of generated text for coherence, relevance, and creativity. This can be conducted through surveys or expert reviews.

### 📉 Diversity Metrics 📉

Assessing the diversity of generated text ensures that the model produces varied and creative outputs rather than repetitive content.

```python
# Calculate Unique Words in Generated Text
def calculate_diversity(texts):
    unique_words = set()
    total_words = 0
    for text in texts:
        words = text.split()
        unique_words.update(words)
        total_words += len(words)
    diversity = len(unique_words) / total_words
    return diversity

diversity = calculate_diversity(generated)
print(f"Diversity: {diversity:.2f}")
```

## 7. 🛠️📈 Example Project: Generating Creative Movie Synopses 🛠️📈

### 📋 Project Overview

**Objective**: Develop an advanced text generation system to create creative and coherent movie synopses using Transformer-based language models. This project will involve fine-tuning a pre-trained GPT-2 model on a dataset of movie synopses, generating new synopses, and evaluating their quality.

**Tools**: Python, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, pandas, NLTK, matplotlib, seaborn

### 📝 Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Load and Explore the Dataset

We'll use a dataset of movie synopses. For this example, assume we have a CSV file named `movie_synopses.csv` with a column `Synopsis`.

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load Dataset
df = pd.read_csv('movie_synopses.csv')
print(df.head())

# Check for Missing Values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Drop Missing Values
df.dropna(subset=['Synopsis'], inplace=True)

# Display Sample Synopses
print(df.sample(5))
```

#### 2. Data Preprocessing

Clean the text data to prepare it for model training.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
import re
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Download NLTK data
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

# Initialize Lemmatizer and Stop Words
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Text Cleaning Function
def clean_text(text):
    # Remove non-letters
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', text)
    # Tokenize
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    # Remove stop words and lemmatize
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens if word not in stop_words]
    return ' '.join(tokens)

# Apply Cleaning
df['Cleaned_Synopsis'] = df['Synopsis'].apply(clean_text)
print(df[['Synopsis', 'Cleaned_Synopsis']].head())
```

#### 3. Setting Up the Transformer Model

Fine-tune GPT-2 on the cleaned synopses.

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer, TextDataset, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load pre-trained GPT-2 tokenizer and model
model_name = 'gpt2'
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Save the cleaned synopses to a text file for training
df['Cleaned_Synopsis'].to_csv('cleaned_synopses.txt', index=False, header=False)

# Create TextDataset
def load_dataset(file_path, tokenizer, block_size=128):
    return TextDataset(
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        file_path=file_path,
        block_size=block_size
    )

train_dataset = load_dataset('cleaned_synopses.txt', tokenizer)

# Data Collator
data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer, mlm=False,
)

# Define Training Arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./gpt2-movie-synopsis',
    overwrite_output_dir=True,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    save_steps=500,
    save_total_limit=2,
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
)

# Fine-Tune the Model
trainer.train()

# Save the Fine-Tuned Model
trainer.save_model('./gpt2-movie-synopsis')
tokenizer.save_pretrained('./gpt2-movie-synopsis')
```

#### 4. Fine-Tuning the Model

The fine-tuning process adapts GPT-2 to generate movie synopses that align with the style and content of the training data.

```python
# Already integrated into the training steps above
# Ensure the model and tokenizer are saved for future use
```

#### 5. Generating Synopses

Use the fine-tuned model to generate new movie synopses based on prompts.

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load the fine-tuned model and tokenizer
model_path = './gpt2-movie-synopsis'
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_path)
model.eval()

# Function to Generate Synopsis
def generate_synopsis(prompt, max_length=100):
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt')
    outputs = model.generate(
        inputs,
        max_length=max_length,
        num_return_sequences=1,
        no_repeat_ngram_size=2,
        temperature=0.7,
        top_k=50,
        top_p=0.95,
        early_stopping=True
    )
    synopsis = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return synopsis

# Generate a Synopsis
prompt = "In a world where"
generated_synopsis = generate_synopsis(prompt)
print(generated_synopsis)
```

**Sample Output:**
```
In a world where technology controls every aspect of life, a young hacker discovers a hidden truth that could change humanity forever. As she delves deeper into the secrets of the system, she forms unlikely alliances and faces formidable adversaries, leading to a thrilling climax that tests her courage and ingenuity.
```

#### 6. Evaluating the Generated Text

Assess the quality and coherence of the generated synopses using both automated metrics and human evaluation.

```python
from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu

# Sample Reference Synopsis
reference = [["in", "a", "world", "where", "technology", "controls", "every", "aspect", "of", "life"]]

# Tokenize Generated Synopsis
candidate = word_tokenize(generated_synopsis.lower())

# Calculate BLEU Score
bleu_score = sentence_bleu(reference, candidate)
print(f"BLEU Score: {bleu_score:.2f}")
```

**Sample Output:**
```
BLEU Score: 0.25
```

*Note: BLEU scores are more meaningful with multiple reference sentences. For better evaluation, consider using higher-order BLEU scores or other metrics.*
