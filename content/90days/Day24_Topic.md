## 3. 🧠 Introduction to Reinforcement Learning Basics 🧠

### 📚 What is Reinforcement Learning?

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a branch of machine learning where an **agent** learns to make decisions by performing actions in an **environment** to achieve **maximal cumulative rewards**. Unlike supervised learning, RL relies on the agent's interactions with the environment to learn optimal behaviors without explicit instruction.

### 🔍 Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning

- **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker.
- **Environment**: The external system the agent interacts with.
- **State**: A representation of the current situation of the agent.
- **Action**: Choices the agent can make.
- **Reward**: Feedback from the environment to evaluate actions.
- **Policy**: Strategy that the agent employs to determine actions based on states.
- **Value Function**: Estimates the expected cumulative reward from a state.
- **Q-Function**: Represents the value of taking a particular action in a given state.

### 🔄 Types of Reinforcement Learning

1. **Model-Based RL**: The agent builds a model of the environment to make decisions.
2. **Model-Free RL**: The agent learns directly from interactions without modeling the environment.
    - **Value-Based Methods**: Focus on estimating value functions (e.g., Q-Learning).
    - **Policy-Based Methods**: Directly optimize the policy (e.g., Policy Gradients).
    - **Actor-Critic Methods**: Combine value-based and policy-based approaches.

### 🔄 Applications of Reinforcement Learning

- **Game Playing**: Achieving superhuman performance in games like Go and chess.
- **Robotics**: Enabling robots to learn tasks through trial and error.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Learning navigation and control strategies.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Personalizing content based on user interactions.
- **Finance**: Optimizing trading strategies and portfolio management.

## 4. 🛠️ Core Components and Algorithms in Reinforcement Learning 🛠️

### 📊 Agent, Environment, and Rewards

- **Agent**: The entity making decisions.
- **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with.
- **Rewards**: Immediate feedback from the environment based on the agent's actions.

### 📊 Policies and Value Functions

- **Policy (π)**: A mapping from states to actions, guiding the agent's behavior.
- **Value Function (V)**: Estimates the expected return (cumulative reward) from a state.
- **Q-Function (Q)**: Estimates the expected return from taking an action in a state.

### 🔄 Exploration vs. Exploitation

- **Exploration**: Trying new actions to discover their effects.
- **Exploitation**: Choosing actions that are known to yield high rewards.
- **Balance**: Effective RL requires a balance between exploration and exploitation to optimize learning.

### 🔄 Key Algorithms

#### 🧰 Q-Learning

A value-based, model-free RL algorithm that seeks to learn the quality of actions, denoted as Q-values.

```python
import numpy as np

class QLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, learning_rate=0.1, gamma=0.95, epsilon=1.0, epsilon_decay=0.995, epsilon_min=0.01):
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.q_table = np.zeros((state_size, action_size))
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.epsilon_decay = epsilon_decay
        self.epsilon_min = epsilon_min
    
    def choose_action(self, state):
        if np.random.rand() < self.epsilon:
            return np.random.randint(self.action_size)
        return np.argmax(self.q_table[state])
    
    def learn(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        target = reward + self.gamma * np.max(self.q_table[next_state]) * (not done)
        self.q_table[state, action] += self.learning_rate * (target - self.q_table[state, action])
        if done:
            self.epsilon = max(self.epsilon_min, self.epsilon * self.epsilon_decay)
```

#### 🧰 Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

An extension of Q-Learning using deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function, handling large or continuous state spaces.

#### 🧰 Policy Gradient Methods

Algorithms that directly optimize the policy by adjusting the parameters to maximize expected rewards.

#### 🧰 Actor-Critic Methods

Combine value-based and policy-based methods, using an actor to propose actions and a critic to evaluate them.

## 5. 🛠️ Implementing Reinforcement Learning with Scikit-Learn and OpenAI Gym 🛠️

### 🔡 Setting Up the Environment 🔡

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv rl_env
source rl_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: rl_env\Scripts\activate

# Install required libraries
pip install scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy gym
```

### 🤖 Setting Up OpenAI Gym 🤖

OpenAI Gym provides a suite of environments for developing and comparing RL algorithms.

```python
import gym

# Initialize the CartPole environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
state_size = env.observation_space.n if isinstance(env.observation_space, gym.spaces.Discrete) else env.observation_space.shape[0]
action_size = env.action_space.n
print(f"State Size: {state_size}, Action Size: {action_size}")
```

### 🧰 Building a Simple Q-Learning Agent 🧰

Implement a basic Q-Learning agent for the CartPole environment.

```python
class QLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, learning_rate=0.1, gamma=0.95, epsilon=1.0, epsilon_decay=0.995, epsilon_min=0.01):
        self.state_size = state_size
        self.action_size = action_size
        self.q_table = np.zeros((state_size, action_size))
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.epsilon_decay = epsilon_decay
        self.epsilon_min = epsilon_min
    
    def choose_action(self, state):
        if np.random.rand() < self.epsilon:
            return np.random.randint(self.action_size)
        return np.argmax(self.q_table[state])
    
    def learn(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        target = reward + self.gamma * np.max(self.q_table[next_state]) * (not done)
        self.q_table[state, action] += self.learning_rate * (target - self.q_table[state, action])
        if done:
            self.epsilon = max(self.epsilon_min, self.epsilon * self.epsilon_decay)
```

### 📈 Training the Agent 📈

Train the Q-Learning agent over multiple episodes.

```python
def train_agent(env, agent, episodes=1000, max_steps=200):
    rewards = []
    for episode in range(episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        total_reward = 0
        for step in range(max_steps):
            action = agent.choose_action(state)
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
            agent.learn(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
            state = next_state
            total_reward += reward
            if done:
                break
        rewards.append(total_reward)
        if (episode + 1) % 100 == 0:
            avg_reward = np.mean(rewards[-100:])
            print(f"Episode {episode+1}/{episodes}, Average Reward: {avg_reward}")
    return rewards

# Initialize Agent
agent = QLearningAgent(state_size=20, action_size=2)  # Example state_size, adjust based on discretization

# Train the Agent
rewards = train_agent(env, agent, episodes=1000)
```

*Note: The state space for CartPole is continuous. To apply Q-Learning, discretize the state space accordingly.*

### 📊 Evaluating the Agent 📊

Assess the trained agent's performance.

```python
def evaluate_agent(env, agent, episodes=100, max_steps=200):
    total_rewards = []
    for episode in range(episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        total_reward = 0
        for step in range(max_steps):
            action = agent.choose_action(state)
            state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
            total_reward += reward
            if done:
                break
        total_rewards.append(total_reward)
    avg_reward = np.mean(total_rewards)
    print(f"Average Reward over {episodes} episodes: {avg_reward}")
    return total_rewards

# Evaluate the Agent
evaluation_rewards = evaluate_agent(env, agent, episodes=100)
```

# Exploration of state and action spaces
print(f"State Space: {env.observation_space}")
print(f"Action Space: {env.action_space}")
```

#### 2. Data Preprocessing and Discretization

Since CartPole has a continuous state space, discretize it to apply Q-Learning.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import KBinsDiscretizer

# Define number of bins for discretization
n_bins = 20

# Define limits for each state variable
state_bounds = list(zip(env.observation_space.low, env.observation_space.high))
state_bounds[1] = (-4.8, 4.8)  # Cart Velocity
state_bounds[3] = (-4.0, 4.0)  # Pole Velocity At Tip

# Create a discretizer
discretizer = KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=n_bins, encode='ordinal', strategy='uniform')

# Fit the discretizer on a sample of the state space
sample_states = np.random.uniform(low=[s[0] for s in state_bounds],
                                 high=[s[1] for s in state_bounds],
                                 size=(10000, 4))
discretizer.fit(sample_states)
```

#### 3. Initialize the Q-Table

```python
# Initialize Q-Table with zeros
q_table = np.zeros((n_bins, n_bins, n_bins, n_bins, env.action_space.n))
```

#### 4. Implement the Q-Learning Algorithm

```python
class QLearningAgent:
    def __init__(self, q_table, learning_rate=0.1, gamma=0.99, epsilon=1.0, epsilon_decay=0.995, epsilon_min=0.01):
        self.q_table = q_table
        self.lr = learning_rate
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.epsilon_decay = epsilon_decay
        self.epsilon_min = epsilon_min
    
    def choose_action(self, state):
        if np.random.rand() < self.epsilon:
            return np.random.choice(env.action_space.n)
        return np.argmax(self.q_table[state])
    
    def learn(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
        best_next_action = np.argmax(self.q_table[next_state])
        target = reward + self.gamma * self.q_table[next_state + (best_next_action,)] * (not done)
        self.q_table[state + (action,)] += self.lr * (target - self.q_table[state + (action,)])

def discretize_state(state, discretizer, state_bounds, n_bins):
    state_adj = []
    for i in range(len(state)):
        if state[i] <= state_bounds[i][0]:
            state_adj.append(state_bounds[i][0])
        elif state[i] >= state_bounds[i][1]:
            state_adj.append(state_bounds[i][1])
        else:
            state_adj.append(state[i])
    return tuple(discretizer.transform([state_adj])[0].astype(int))

episodes = 1000
max_steps = 200
rewards = []

for episode in range(episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    state = discretize_state(state, discretizer, state_bounds, n_bins)
    total_reward = 0
    for step in range(max_steps):
        action = agent.choose_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        next_state = discretize_state(next_state, discretizer, state_bounds, n_bins)
        agent.learn(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        state = next_state
        total_reward += reward
        if done:
            break
    rewards.append(total_reward)
    if (episode + 1) % 100 == 0:
        avg_reward = np.mean(rewards[-100:])
        print(f"Episode {episode+1}/{episodes}, Average Reward: {avg_reward}")
```
