## 1. 🌟 Welcome to Day 13

Welcome to **Day 13** of "Becoming a Scikit-Learn Boss in 90 Days"! Today, we'll dive into the fascinating world of **Topic Modeling**, focusing on **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**. Topic modeling is a powerful technique for discovering hidden themes or topics within large collections of text data. By mastering LDA, you'll enhance your NLP projects with the ability to uncover meaningful patterns and gain deeper insights from textual information.

---

## 2. 🔍 Review of Day 12 📜

Before diving into today's topics, let's briefly recap what we covered yesterday:

- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Explored techniques for understanding the grammatical structure and identifying entities within text.
- **Implementing POS Tagging and NER with Python**: Applied POS tagging using NLTK and NER using spaCy, integrating these techniques into Scikit-Learn pipelines.
- **Example Project**: Enhanced a sentiment analysis model by incorporating POS tags and NER entities, leading to improved accuracy and deeper insights.

With this foundation, we're now ready to explore Topic Modeling, further expanding our NLP toolkit.

## 3. 🧠 Introduction to Topic Modeling and LDA 🧠

### 📚 What is Topic Modeling?

**Topic Modeling** is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify and categorize topics within a collection of documents. It helps in summarizing, organizing, and understanding large volumes of text data by discovering the underlying themes that pervade the documents.

### 🔍 Understanding Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

**Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** is one of the most popular topic modeling algorithms. It assumes that documents are mixtures of topics, and topics are mixtures of words. LDA discovers the hidden thematic structure in a corpus by estimating:

- **Topics**: Probabilistic distributions over words.
- **Document-Topic Distributions**: Probabilistic distributions over topics for each document.

### 🔄 Applications of Topic Modeling

- **Document Classification**: Organize documents into categories based on discovered topics.
- **Information Retrieval**: Enhance search algorithms by understanding the thematic content.
- **Content Recommendation**: Suggest related content based on topic similarity.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify emerging themes and monitor changes over time.
- **Summarization**: Generate summaries highlighting key topics within documents.

## 4. 🛠️ Techniques for Topic Modeling 🛠️

### 🔡 Preprocessing Text Data for LDA 🔡

Effective preprocessing is crucial for successful topic modeling. Steps include:

1. **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
2. **Lowercasing**: Converting all text to lowercase to maintain consistency.
3. **Removing Stop Words**: Eliminating common words that do not contribute to topic differentiation.
4. **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or root form.
5. **Removing Rare Words and Phrases**: Excluding words that appear too infrequently or too frequently across documents.
6. **Creating N-grams**: Capturing multi-word expressions that convey specific meanings.

### 📊 Feature Extraction for LDA 📊

Transforming text data into numerical features suitable for LDA involves:

#### 👜 Bag of Words (BoW) 👜

Represents text by counting the frequency of each word in the document. It disregards grammar and word order but retains multiplicity.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

corpus = [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "Never jump over the lazy dog quickly.",
    "A fast brown fox leaps over a sleepy dog."
]

vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print(X.toarray())
```

#### 📏 Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) 📏

Measures the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire corpus, balancing word frequency with rarity.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print(X_tfidf.toarray())
```

### 🧰 Implementing LDA with Scikit-Learn 🧰

Scikit-Learn provides a robust implementation of LDA through the `LatentDirichletAllocation` class.

#### 🔍 Choosing the Number of Topics 🔍

Selecting the appropriate number of topics (`n_components`) is essential. Common approaches include:

- **Elbow Method**: Plotting model performance metrics (e.g., coherence) against the number of topics and identifying the "elbow" point.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Leveraging expertise to estimate a reasonable number of topics.
- **Cross-Validation**: Evaluating models with different topic numbers and selecting the best-performing one.

#### 📈 Fitting the LDA Model 📈

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation

# Initialize LDA
lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=3, random_state=42)

# Fit LDA on the BoW features
lda.fit(X)

# Display Topics
for idx, topic in enumerate(lda.components_):
    print(f"Topic #{idx + 1}:")
    print([vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()[i] for i in topic.argsort()[:-11:-1]])
```

#### 📖 Interpreting the Topics 📖

After fitting the LDA model, interpret each topic by examining the top words associated with it. This helps in understanding the thematic structure of the corpus.

## 5. 🛠️ Implementing Topic Modeling with Scikit-Learn 🛠️

### 🔡 Text Preprocessing Example 🔡

```python
import pandas as pd
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
import re

# Download NLTK data
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

# Initialize Lemmatizer and Stop Words
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Document': [
        "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
        "Never jump over the lazy dog quickly.",
        "A fast brown fox leaps over a sleepy dog."
    ]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Text Cleaning Function
def clean_text(text):
    # Remove non-letters
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', text)
    # Tokenize
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text.lower())
    # Remove stop words and lemmatize
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens if word not in stop_words]
    return ' '.join(tokens)

# Apply Cleaning
df['Cleaned'] = df['Document'].apply(clean_text)
print(df[['Document', 'Cleaned']])
```

### 📊 Feature Extraction Example 📊

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Initialize CountVectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['Cleaned'])

# Display Feature Names and Counts
print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print(X.toarray())
```

### 🧰 Building and Training the LDA Model 🧰

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation

# Initialize LDA with 2 topics
lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=2, random_state=42)

# Fit LDA on BoW features
lda.fit(X)

# Display Topics
for idx, topic in enumerate(lda.components_):
    print(f"Topic #{idx + 1}:")
    print([vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()[i] for i in topic.argsort()[:-6:-1]])
```

### 📖 Visualizing and Interpreting Topics 📖

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Function to Display Topics
def display_topics(model, feature_names, no_top_words):
    for topic_idx, topic in enumerate(model.components_):
        print(f"Topic #{topic_idx + 1}:")
        print(" ".join([feature_names[i] for i in topic.argsort()[:-no_top_words - 1:-1]]))
    print()

# Display Top 5 Words for Each Topic
display_topics(lda, vectorizer.get_feature_names_out(), 5)

# Visualize Topic Distribution in Documents
import numpy as np

topic_distributions = lda.transform(X)
df_topic = pd.DataFrame(topic_distributions, columns=[f"Topic {i+1}" for i in range(lda.n_components_)])
print(df_topic)

# Plot Topic Distribution
df_topic.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, figsize=(8,6))
plt.title('Topic Distribution per Document')
plt.xlabel('Document Index')
plt.ylabel('Topic Proportion')
plt.show()
```

## 6. 📈 Model Evaluation for Topic Modeling 📈

### 🧮 Perplexity and Coherence Scores 🧮

- **Perplexity**: Measures how well a probability model predicts a sample. Lower perplexity indicates a better fit.
  
  ```python
  # Calculate Perplexity
  perplexity = lda.perplexity(X)
  print(f"Perplexity: {perplexity:.2f}")
  ```

- **Coherence Score**: Measures the semantic similarity of words within a topic. Higher coherence indicates more meaningful topics.
  
  *Note: Scikit-Learn does not provide a built-in coherence score. Use the `gensim` library for coherence calculations.*

  ```python
  from gensim.models import CoherenceModel
  from gensim.corpora.dictionary import Dictionary

  # Prepare Data for Gensim
  texts = df['Cleaned'].apply(lambda x: x.split()).tolist()
  dictionary = Dictionary(texts)
  corpus_gensim = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in texts]

  # Initialize Gensim LDA Model
  from gensim.models.ldamodel import LdaModel

  lda_gensim = LdaModel(corpus=corpus_gensim, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=2, random_state=42, passes=10)

  # Calculate Coherence Score
  coherence_model_lda = CoherenceModel(model=lda_gensim, texts=texts, dictionary=dictionary, coherence='c_v')
  coherence_lda = coherence_model_lda.get_coherence()
  print(f"Coherence Score: {coherence_lda:.2f}")
  ```

### 📉 Visual Evaluation with Word Clouds 📉

Visualizing topics using word clouds can provide an intuitive understanding of the prominent words in each topic.

```python
from wordcloud import WordCloud

# Function to Generate Word Cloud for a Topic
def generate_wordcloud(model, feature_names, topic_idx):
    topic = model.components_[topic_idx]
    word_freq = {feature_names[i]: topic[i] for i in range(len(feature_names))}
    wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate_from_frequencies(word_freq)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
    plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.title(f"Topic #{topic_idx + 1}")
    plt.show()

# Generate Word Clouds for Each Topic
for topic_idx in range(lda.n_components_):
    generate_wordcloud(lda, vectorizer.get_feature_names_out(), topic_idx)
```

### 🔍 Topic Diversity 🔍

Ensuring that topics are distinct and cover different themes is important for meaningful analysis. High topic diversity indicates that topics are not overlapping significantly.

```python
# Calculate Topic Diversity
topics = [sorted([vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()[i] for i in topic.argsort()[:-6:-1]]) for topic in lda.components_]
unique_words = set(word for topic in topics for word in topic)
topic_diversity = len(unique_words) / (lda.n_components_ * 5)
print(f"Topic Diversity: {topic_diversity:.2f}")
```

## 7. 🛠️📈 Example Project: Discovering Topics in News Articles 🛠️📈

### 📋 Project Overview

**Objective**: Utilize Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover hidden themes within a collection of news articles. This project will involve preprocessing text data, extracting features, building and training the LDA model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the discovered topics.

**Tools**: Python, Scikit-Learn, pandas, NLTK, spaCy, matplotlib, seaborn, gensim, wordcloud

### 📝 Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Load and Explore the Dataset

We'll use a dataset of news articles. For this example, assume we have a CSV file named `news_articles.csv` with a column `Content`.

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load Dataset
df = pd.read_csv('news_articles.csv')
print(df.head())

# Check for Missing Values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Drop Missing Values
df.dropna(subset=['Content'], inplace=True)

# Display Sample Articles
print(df.sample(5))
```

#### 2. Data Preprocessing

Clean the text data to prepare it for feature extraction.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
import re
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Download NLTK data
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')

# Initialize Lemmatizer and Stop Words
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Text Cleaning Function
def clean_text(text):
    # Remove non-letters
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', text)
    # Tokenize
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    # Remove stop words and lemmatize
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in tokens if word not in stop_words]
    return ' '.join(tokens)

# Apply Cleaning
df['Cleaned_Content'] = df['Content'].apply(clean_text)
print(df[['Content', 'Cleaned_Content']].head())
```

#### 3. Feature Extraction

Convert the cleaned text into numerical features using TF-IDF.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Initialize TfidfVectorizer
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000, ngram_range=(1,2))
X_tfidf = tfidf.fit_transform(df['Cleaned_Content'])

# Display Feature Names and Shape
print(tfidf.get_feature_names_out())
print(X_tfidf.shape)
```

#### 4. Building and Training the LDA Model

Fit the LDA model to the TF-IDF features to discover topics.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation

# Initialize LDA with 5 topics
lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=5, random_state=42, learning_method='batch')

# Fit LDA on TF-IDF features
lda.fit(X_tfidf)

# Display Topics
def display_topics(model, feature_names, no_top_words):
    for idx, topic in enumerate(model.components_):
        print(f"Topic #{idx + 1}:")
        print(" ".join([feature_names[i] for i in topic.argsort()[:-no_top_words - 1:-1]]))
    print()

display_topics(lda, tfidf.get_feature_names_out(), 10)
```

#### 5. Evaluating the Model

Assess the LDA model using perplexity and coherence scores.

```python
# Calculate Perplexity
perplexity = lda.perplexity(X_tfidf)
print(f"Perplexity: {perplexity:.2f}")

# Calculate Coherence Score using Gensim
from gensim.models import CoherenceModel
from gensim.corpora.dictionary import Dictionary
import gensim

# Prepare Data for Gensim
texts = df['Cleaned_Content'].apply(lambda x: x.split()).tolist()
dictionary = Dictionary(texts)
corpus_gensim = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in texts]

# Initialize Gensim LDA Model
lda_gensim = gensim.models.LdaModel(corpus=corpus_gensim, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=5, random_state=42, passes=10)

# Calculate Coherence Score
coherence_model_lda = CoherenceModel(model=lda_gensim, texts=texts, dictionary=dictionary, coherence='c_v')
coherence_lda = coherence_model_lda.get_coherence()
print(f"Coherence Score: {coherence_lda:.2f}")
```

#### 6. Visualizing Topics

Use word clouds to visualize the prominent words in each topic.

```python
from wordcloud import WordCloud

# Function to Generate Word Cloud for a Topic
def generate_wordcloud(model, feature_names, topic_idx):
    topic = model.components_[topic_idx]
    word_freq = {feature_names[i]: topic[i] for i in range(len(feature_names))}
    wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate_from_frequencies(word_freq)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
    plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.title(f"Topic #{topic_idx + 1}")
    plt.show()

# Generate Word Clouds for Each Topic
for topic_idx in range(lda.n_components_):
    generate_wordcloud(lda, tfidf.get_feature_names_out(), topic_idx)
```
