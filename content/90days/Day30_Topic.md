## 3. 🧠 Introduction to Securing Machine Learning APIs 🧠

### 📚 Importance of API Security

Securing your ML APIs is vital for several reasons:

- **Protect Sensitive Data**: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive input and output data.
- **Maintain Integrity**: Ensure that the data processed by your models remains accurate and unaltered.
- **Ensure Availability**: Protect your APIs from attacks that could render them unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to data protection regulations and industry standards.

### 🔍 Common Security Threats

Understanding potential threats helps in implementing effective security measures:

- **Unauthorized Access**: Malicious actors gaining access to your APIs without proper authorization.
- **Data Breaches**: Sensitive data being exposed or stolen.
- **Injection Attacks**: Malicious inputs designed to exploit vulnerabilities in your API.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**: Overwhelming your API with excessive requests to disrupt service.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Intercepting and altering communications between clients and your API.

### 🔄 Security Best Practices

Adopting best practices enhances the security posture of your ML APIs:

- **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization**: Ensure that only authorized users can access your APIs.
- **Use HTTPS for Encrypted Communication**: Protect data in transit by enabling SSL/TLS.
- **Validate and Sanitize Inputs**: Prevent injection attacks by rigorously validating user inputs.
- **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: Mitigate DoS attacks by limiting the number of requests a client can make.
- **Regularly Update Dependencies**: Keep your software and dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Monitor and Log Activities**: Track API usage and detect suspicious activities through comprehensive logging.

---

## 4. 🛠️ Key Security Practices for ML APIs 🛠️

### 📊 Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users or services accessing your API.
  - **API Keys**: Simple tokens assigned to users for access.
  - **OAuth2**: Delegated access using tokens, suitable for third-party integrations.
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Compact tokens containing user claims, enabling stateless authentication.

- **Authorization**: Defining what authenticated users are permitted to do.
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigning permissions based on user roles.
  - **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Granting access based on user attributes and policies.

### 📊 Data Encryption

- **In Transit**: Encrypt data being transmitted between clients and your API using HTTPS (SSL/TLS).
- **At Rest**: Encrypt stored data to protect it from unauthorized access, especially in cloud storage.

### 📊 Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Validate Data Types and Formats**: Ensure that inputs conform to expected types and structures.
- **Sanitize Inputs**: Remove or escape harmful characters to prevent injection attacks.
- **Use Schemas**: Define and enforce data schemas using tools like Pydantic in FastAPI.

### 📊 Rate Limiting and Throttling

- **Rate Limiting**: Restrict the number of requests a client can make within a specific timeframe.
- **Throttling**: Control the request rate to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse.
- **Tools**: Utilize middleware or third-party services like Redis-based rate limiters.

### 📊 Logging and Monitoring

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Record all API requests, responses, and errors for audit trails.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track API performance and detect anomalies using monitoring tools.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for unusual activities or performance degradations.

### 📊 Secure API Design

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users and services.
- **Use HTTPS**: Enforce secure communication channels.
- **Implement CORS Policies**: Control which domains can interact with your API to prevent cross-site request forgery.

## 5. 🛠️ Implementing Security in FastAPI 🛠️

### 🔡 Setting Up Authentication

Implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.

**Using OAuth2 with Password (and Bearer) in FastAPI:**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional
import jwt

app = FastAPI()

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"

class Token(BaseModel):
    access_token: str
    token_type: str

@app.post("/token", response_model=Token)
def login(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):
    # Replace with your user verification logic
    if form_data.username != "admin" or form_data.password != "password":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Incorrect username or password",
            headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
        )
    access_token = jwt.encode({"sub": form_data.username}, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return {"access_token": access_token, "token_type": "bearer"}

def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        username: str = payload.get("sub")
        if username is None:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid token")
        return username
    except jwt.PyJWTError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid token")
```

### 🔡 Implementing Authorization

Define user roles and permissions to control access to API endpoints.

```python
from fastapi import Security

class User(BaseModel):
    username: str
    role: str

def get_current_active_user(current_user: str = Depends(get_current_user)):
    # Replace with your user retrieval logic
    user = User(username=current_user, role="admin")
    if user.role != "admin":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Insufficient permissions")
    return user

@app.get("/secure-data")
def read_secure_data(user: User = Depends(get_current_active_user)):
    return {"data": "This is secure data accessible only to admin users."}
```

### 🔡 Enabling HTTPS

Ensure all communications are encrypted by configuring HTTPS.

- **Development**: Use tools like `uvicorn` with SSL certificates.

  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --ssl-keyfile=key.pem --ssl-certfile=cert.pem
  ```

- **Production**: Use reverse proxies like Nginx or cloud services to handle SSL termination.

### 🔡 Adding Rate Limiting

Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make.

**Using `slowapi` for Rate Limiting in FastAPI:**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from slowapi import Limiter, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address
from slowapi.errors import RateLimitExceeded

app = FastAPI()
limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)
app.state.limiter = limiter
app.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler)

@app.get("/limited")
@limiter.limit("5/minute")
def limited_route(request: Request):
    return {"message": "This route is rate limited to 5 requests per minute."}
```

### 🔡 Validating and Sanitizing Inputs

Ensure all inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class InputData(BaseModel):
    input: list

    @validator('input')
    def validate_input(cls, v):
        if not isinstance(v, list):
            raise ValueError('Input must be a list.')
        if not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in v):
            raise ValueError('All elements in input must be numbers.')
        return v
```

## 6. 📈 Example Project: Securing a FastAPI ML API 📈

### 📋 Project Overview

**Objective**: Enhance the security of a deployed Scikit-Learn Iris classification model by implementing authentication, authorization, encrypted communication, rate limiting, and input validation using FastAPI.

**Tools**: Python, FastAPI, Scikit-Learn, Joblib, JWT, Docker, Uvicorn, Postman

### 📝 Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Train and Save the Scikit-Learn Model

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')
```

#### 2. Set Up the FastAPI Application with Security

Create `main.py` incorporating authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and input validation.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status, Request, Response
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator
from typing import Optional
import jwt
from slowapi import Limiter, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address
from slowapi.errors import RateLimitExceeded
import joblib
import numpy as np

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize rate limiter
limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)
app.state.limiter = limiter
app.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler)

# JWT settings
SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"

oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

# Define Token and User models
class Token(BaseModel):
    access_token: str
    token_type: str

class User(BaseModel):
    username: str
    role: str

# Define Input Data model with validation
class InputData(BaseModel):
    input: list

    @validator('input')
    def validate_input(cls, v):
        if not isinstance(v, list):
            raise ValueError('Input must be a list.')
        if not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in v):
            raise ValueError('All elements in input must be numbers.')
        return v

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('model.pkl')

# Authentication endpoint
@app.post("/token", response_model=Token)
def login(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):
    # Replace with your user verification logic
    if form_data.username != "admin" or form_data.password != "password":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Incorrect username or password",
            headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Bearer"},
        )
    access_token = jwt.encode({"sub": form_data.username, "role": "admin"}, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return {"access_token": access_token, "token_type": "bearer"}

# Dependency to get current user
def get_current_user(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)) -> User:
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        username: str = payload.get("sub")
        role: str = payload.get("role")
        if username is None or role is None:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid token")
        return User(username=username, role=role)
    except jwt.PyJWTError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid token")

# Secure prediction endpoint
@app.post("/predict")
@limiter.limit("10/minute")
def predict(data: InputData, user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    input_features = np.array(data.input).reshape(1, -1)
    prediction = model.predict(input_features)
    return {"prediction": prediction.tolist()}

# Metrics endpoint (if monitoring is set up)
@app.get("/metrics")
def metrics():
    return Response("Metrics data here", media_type="text/plain")
```

#### 3. Implement Authentication and Authorization

As shown in the `main.py` above, JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization are implemented to secure the `/predict` endpoint.

#### 4. Enable HTTPS and Secure Communication

- **Development**: Run the FastAPI application with SSL certificates.

  ```bash
  uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --ssl-keyfile=key.pem --ssl-certfile=cert.pem
  ```

- **Production**: Use a reverse proxy like Nginx to handle SSL termination.

#### 5. Add Rate Limiting

Implemented using the `slowapi` library to limit the `/predict` endpoint to 10 requests per minute per client.

#### 6. Validate and Sanitize Inputs

Implemented through Pydantic validators in the `InputData` model to ensure that inputs are lists of numbers.

#### 7. Containerize the Secure API with Docker

Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the secured FastAPI application.

```dockerfile
# Use the official Python image as the base
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port FastAPI is running on
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

Create `requirements.txt`:

```txt
fastapi
uvicorn
scikit-learn
joblib
jwt
pydantic
slowapi
```

Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t secure-iris-fastapi-app .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 secure-iris-fastapi-app
```

#### 8. Deploy to a Cloud Platform

Deploy the secured Docker container to a cloud platform of your choice (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) using their respective container services like **AWS ECS**, **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**, or **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.

#### 9. Test the Secured API

Use **Postman** or **cURL** to test the secured `/predict` endpoint.

1. **Obtain a Token**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/token \
        -F "username=admin" \
        -F "password=password"
   ```

   **Expected Response**:

   ```json
   {
     "access_token": "your-jwt-token",
     "token_type": "bearer"
   }
   ```

2. **Make a Secured Prediction Request**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"input": [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]}'
   ```

   **Expected Response**:

   ```json
   {
     "prediction": [0]
   }
   ```
