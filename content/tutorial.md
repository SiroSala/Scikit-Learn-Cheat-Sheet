## üß™ Interactive Examples

### Example 1: Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Sample dataset
X = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]
y = [1.5, 3.2, 4.8, 6.4, 8.1]

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
```

### Example 2: Visualizing Data with Matplotlib

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Create line plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(x, y, label="Linear Growth", marker="o")
plt.title("Sample Line Plot")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```
